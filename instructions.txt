Ah, this is a classic and very revealing symptom. The behavior you're describing—the titlebar scrolling with the content for a moment before snapping back—is a tell-tale sign that JavaScript is trying to manage the titlebar's position.

You have uncovered a conflict between your CSS and your application's JavaScript. Removing overflow: hidden didn't break the titlebar; it exposed a pre-existing issue.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what's happening and how to fix it properly.
The Root Cause: A Battle Between CSS and JavaScript

Your CSS for the .titlebar is excellent and uses the most efficient method to keep it in place:
code Css
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
.titlebar {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0 0 auto 0; /* This tells the browser: "Pin this to the top/left/right of the viewport. Period." */
  /* ... */
}

  

This is a declarative approach. You are telling the browser what you want, and the browser's highly optimized rendering engine handles it perfectly. A position: fixed element should never move with the scroll, not even for a millisecond.

The "jumpy" behavior you're seeing is the signature of an imperative JavaScript approach, which works like this:

    A JavaScript event listener is watching for the user to scroll (window.addEventListener('scroll', ...) ).

    When you start scrolling, the browser moves everything on the page, including your titlebar, down by a few pixels. This is the initial scroll you are seeing.

    The JavaScript scroll event then fires.

    The script runs its logic, which is likely something like: "Oh, the user scrolled! I need to move the titlebar back to the top of the screen."

    The script then manually applies a style to the titlebar (e.g., element.style.top = '0px' or element.style.transform = 'translateY(0)') to force it back into place. This is the "jump" you see.

This creates a laggy, unprofessional-looking effect because the script can only react after the browser has already painted the scrolled frame.
Why Removing overflow: hidden Revealed the Problem

The overflow: hidden was likely on a main container, like your <body> or .app-container.

When that property was in place, it was preventing that container from being scrollable at all. If the primary container can't scroll, the user can't perform a scroll action, and therefore the problematic JavaScript scroll event listener was never being triggered.

By removing overflow: hidden, you enabled scrolling on the container. This "activated" the latent JavaScript code, and now you can see the inefficient "scroll-then-jump" battle in action.

Analogy: You didn't break the titlebar; you just opened the floodgates and revealed a leaky pipe that was there all along.
The Solution: Trust Your CSS and Remove the JavaScript

The fix is not to put overflow: hidden back. The correct solution is to find and remove the unnecessary JavaScript code that is trying to manage the titlebar's position. Your CSS is already doing the job perfectly and more efficiently.

    Look in your JavaScript/TypeScript files. Search your project for code that selects the titlebar. Look for keywords like:

        document.querySelector('.titlebar')

        window.addEventListener('scroll'

        .style.top

        .style.transform

        Anything related to calculating scroll position (window.scrollY).

    Identify the scroll handling logic. You will likely find a block of code that looks something like this:
    code JavaScript

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
// THIS IS THE PROBLEMATIC CODE YOU SHOULD REMOVE
const titlebar = document.querySelector('.titlebar');

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  // Some logic here that might check scrollY and then...
  titlebar.style.top = '0px'; // Or some other manual positioning
});

  

Delete or disable that JavaScript code. Your position: fixed in your CSS is all you need. It is the modern, correct, and most performant way to achieve a fixed header. Once the conflicting JavaScript is gone, the browser will handle the titlebar's position flawlessly, and the "jumpy" scrolling will disappear completely.
